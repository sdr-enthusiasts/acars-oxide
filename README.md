# sdr-enthusiasts/acars_oxide

`acars_oxide` is a utility, written in rust, that uses [librtlsdr](https://github.com/librtlsdr) to utilize RTLSDR USB dongles to monitor aircraft ACARS and VDLM2 messages. It is based on the work of [acarsdec](https://github.com/TLeconte/acarsdec), [vdlm2dec](https://github.com/TLeconte/vdlm2dec) and [dumpvdl2](https://github.com/szpajder/dumpvdl2).

## Thanks

With thanks to [TLContente](https://github.com/TLeconte) and [szpajder](https://github.com/szpajder) for their work on `acarsdec/vdlm2dec` and `dumpvdl2` respectively.
